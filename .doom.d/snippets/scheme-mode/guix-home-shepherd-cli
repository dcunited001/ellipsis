;; this snippet is useful when you want an FSM to match a service CLI's actions
;; that transition the service between different FSM states.

;; for FSM-based services whose actions are more abstract (not daemons, but workflows)
;; just use (generic-state ...) macro/factory in rde: ./src/gnu/home-services/state.scm

;; ($1-action ...) defines dsl with matcher
;; - use below when providing documentation for each action
