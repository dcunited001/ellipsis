** Includes

There are includes and they're necessary. If you simply remap keycodes, strange
things may happen. For example, using the following without the include may
cause your control key to "lock" and never unlock. Then alphanumeric keys will
start causing their "control" action.

#+begin_src conf :tangle .local/share/kbd/caps-as-control.inc
include "linux-with-alt-and-altgr.inc"

keycode 58 = Control
#+end_src

** Kharis

Just link to the appropriate include
