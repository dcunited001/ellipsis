# this only applies to a frame created to have the "¤ AGENDA" title, via

# org agenda is often meant to be driven alongside your project, using popup
# buffers that help you jump between contexts (without losing focus). sadly,
# my emacs config/env was inconsistent, so I didn't condition usage of
# org-agenda, even though I studied it's features/config/usage pretty intensly
