This is a guix parent module that helps with code reuse.

* Guix

** Writing Packages

+ OpenSSL has an example of a Spliced G-Expression

+ nothing happens if there's no (arguments...)?

*** Questions
+ how to prevent guile from loading WIP code
  - these packages should definitely not be in dotfiles..
+ arch & nix use =go build= here, but how are go-deps fetched?
+ =guix import go= can consume package metadata and produce guix packages, perhaps recursively
  - [[github:ryanprior/emacs-guix-packaging][ryanprior/emacs-guix-packaging]] can help with this

** Writing Services

* Utils

* Services

* Home Services

* Packages

** Performance

+ cpupower-gui ([[https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=cpupower-gui][AUR]])
  - [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CPU_frequency_scaling#cpupower-gui][CPU Powerscaling]]
+ throttled ([[https://github.com/erpalma/throttled][github]])
  - this may provide fixes for CPU throttling/scaling issues on my laptop, which seems not properly read the =tctl= sensor (it is set +20Â° from tdie, which i can't find)

** Misc

+ libsixel
+ emacs-x509

* Notes

**** TODO fully disambiguate compose/extend/extension
... silly french /agir/

** Performance

+ amd_pstate ([[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/pm/amd-pstate.html][linux docs]]) module is builtin to my kernel
  - but apparently this is very new...
  - cpu must be Zen 2 or higher (laptops? ... i donno?)
  - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxhardware/comments/vww97x/owner_report_hp_victus_16_laptop_with_amd_rx5500m/][enabling amd_pstate driver on a laptop]]
  - and an article from [[https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-P-State-How-To][phoronix]]

inspect current CPU state:

+ lscpu
+ =sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq=
+ =sudo cpupower frequency-info=

inspect current TLP state:

+ =sudo tlp-stat=


** Root Profile

This profile is also created via =/etc/skel= which is defined in =./gnu/system/shadow.scm=

=/etc/profile= should be extended with:

  - special-file-service
  - extra-special-file-service

**** TODO it's not quite clear how this would be extended
+ ideally, i could just append to the files defined by the =/etc/skel= service

** Boot Params

Configure with =sysctl-service-type= and extend/override =%default-sysctl-settings=.

* Systems

** USB GPG Image

This is mostly a reimplementation of the Nix image from [[github:drduh/YubiKey-Guide][drduh/YubiKey-Guide]] in Guix. The image is intended to be used for:

+ GPG key generation
+ SSL keygen
+ [[https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Guides/Certificate_authority.html][Certificate Authority with a Yubikey]]

**** Resources

+ [[https://gnupg.org/aegypten2][gnupg.org/aegypten2]] has an architectural overview of how GnuPG interacts with system services (it's a bit old)

*** Tasks

**** TODO resolve need to use nonguix when generating USB images for laptops requiring non-free firmware

*** Notes

**** Yubico

***** PIV

These packages should not be necessary for my use case.

***** PAM

Modules for yubico PAM. Irrelevant for GPG key creation

#+begin_src scheme :eval no
#:use-module (gnu packages authentication)
;; gnu/packages/openpgp.scm
;; gnu/packages/gnu-pw-mgr.scm
#+end_src

***** Keepass

Modules for keepass w/ yubico support:

#+begin_src scheme :eval no
#:use-module (gnu packages password-utils)
#+end_src

**** Refactoring GnuPG services into modules
